        <ul>
            <li>As a user that is unable to physically shop and browse through clothing in-store due to Victoria
                COVID-19 restrictions, I want to be able to receive a visual representation of how outfits look as well
                as different pieces of clothing look, should I decide to buy a piece of similar clothing online.</li>

            accurately represents the user. The user will be able to choose any clothes that attract them to display
            onto the avatar to have an accurate presentation on how the clothes will look together. The user can also
            put in their own clothes to create a visual representation on their clothes with the clothes they may
            possibly purchase. This gives the user the option to see an example of how the clothes they might buy would
            look together or with already owned clothing.  </p>

        <h3>  User Stories  </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As a user, I have browsed through and selected an outfit that I'm happy with. I want to save this outfit
                to view at a later date should i decide to order the pieces online.</li>

                style has progressed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>  Textual Explanation  </h3>
        <p>This feature allows the user to save their outfits temporarily while on the website. This lets the user be
            able to create multiple outfits in one sitting to compare and share their outfit creations. This feature
            lets the user create their outfits to use at a later date. This allows users to make outfits for later to
            use with any originally owned pieces of clothing to create the outfit when you need to go out. This gives a
            good reference when users need to create an outfit when you need to go out.  </p>
        <h3>  Validation Test  </h3>
        <p> By clicking on a 'save outfit' button, it should save the current composition of clothing
            and be accessible at any time.</p>

            <li>As a user wanting a new outfit, I want the website to recommend to me a random outfit so that I will
                have new ideas and inspiration.</li>
            <li>As a user who is restricted from going shopping in physical stores and retailers due to COVID-19
                restrictions, I want to be able to spend my free time playing around with different outfits to try and
                replace the typical shopping experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>  Textual Explanation  </h3>
        <p>This feature lets the user randomly generate an outfit for their specific gender. The outfits generated are
            random to give the user inspiration or ideas to make their own personal outfit. With this random generated
            outfit feature it gives a new look on different ideas that may have happened in real life stores when
            browsing clothes. This can give the real life feeling of clothes shopping while being at home due to the
            COVID-19 lockdown.  </p>
