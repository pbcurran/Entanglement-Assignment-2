        <p> Below are the tools that our group will use to create our final website. </p>
        <h2> GitHub </h2>
        <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform that will allow all group members to collectively work on our web-based
            project. As our project will require HTML and JavaScript, all group members will be able to have the ability
            to edit all files/code related to creating our assignment.</p>
        <h2> Visual Studio </h2>
        <p>Visual Studio is an integrated development environment from Microsoft, used to develop computer
            programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Some members may choose to
            edit the code using this code editor instead of directly editing on Github.</p>
        <h2> Brackets </h2>
        <p>Brackets is a source code editor, created by Adobe Systems primarily used for web development. Some members
            may choose to edit the code using this code editor instead of directly editing on Github.</p>
        <h2> Trello </h2>
        <p><a href="https://trello.com/b/LVLAZFlH/building-it-systems-project
            ">Trello</a> is a collaborative board where team members are able to organise, delegate and plan their work
            using a
            visual platform. Our group will aim to plan our work/phases using a collaborative Trello board. This will be
            done in order to keep track of tasks that need to be completed, delegate tasks to each member and show to
            members of the group what each individual will be or is working on. Ultimately, Trello will play a large
            part in monitoring our progress and ensuring we remain on track throughout the development process.</p>
        <h2> Collaborative Workspaces </h2>
        <p> Below are the applications and tools that we will use for collaborative work and communication. </p>
        <h3> Microsoft Teams </h3>
        <p>We will use MS <a
                href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a976a614ab4964c69aa9ac34af461c0b8%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=cd941f46-c6f2-49db-ac1b-0ddf3a0b3844tenantId=d1323671-cdbe-4417-b4d4-bdb24b51316b"
                target="_blank">Teams </a>to hold face-to-face meetings between all members as well as tutor/lecturer
            throughout the various phases of the project. This platform will be beneficial for group members to clearly
            discuss and share ideas as opposed to communicating through email/text messaging</p>
        <h3> Google Docs/Google Drive </h3>
        <p>We will use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IRUnwZ6DJIxGR3s-nBzNu4U9NMy9W650txp4jUJsIH0/edit#"
                target="_blank">this</a> platform for collaborative work, where members can see/review each other's work
            before uploading to AWS website.</p>
        <h3> GitHub </h3>
        <p>All members will use GitHub to make changes to our HTML and CSS files. Members will have access to each
            repository (assignments 1 and 2, final project) to contribute and make edits.</p>
        <h3> Trello </h3>
        <p>Trello will be used as a visual representation of the work done by each member. It will also help group
            members keep up with any work that needs to be done/has been done. Trello will also allow mentors to see
            each member's progress regarding their work as well as the whole group as a collective. </p>
        <h3> AWS </h3>
        <p>AWS will be used to host our assignments as well as our final project. </p>
        <h3> Figma </h3>
        <p>Figma is a prototyping tool that can be used to create low to high fidelity prototypes. Our group will use
            Figma to create mock-ups of our website to guide us throughout the creation of our final website.</p>
