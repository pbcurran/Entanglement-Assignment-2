        <h1>Project Background</h1>
        <p>Our website, The Drip Selector, gives users the ability to preview the look of items of clothing on a model.
            The app will allow users to select pictures of pre loaded clothes and see what they will look like together,
            for example a user will be able to select a t-shirt and a pair of jeans and the program will generate each
            of these on an avatar on the screen. This will allow the user to get an accurate representation of what the
            clothes will look like. Users will then be able to follow a link provided by the site which takes them to a
            store front that has the items of clothing they are previewing for sale. We will have different sections for
            Pants, t-shirts and other items of clothing to make the user experience more friendly and organized. <br>
            <br>
            The clothes on the website will be clearly labeled so the user is quickly able to tell the brand and name of
            the clothes that they are previewing. The majority of the page will be taken up by the model that the
            clothes will be placed on and then next to this model will be the selection of clothes that the user can
            place on the model. Next to the pieces of clothing will be links that take the user to a storefront that
            sells that piece of clothing allowing them to quickly access a vendor for this piece.<br>
            <br>
            Given the current situation Victoria is in, many people are not able to leave their suburbs, let alone
            purchase clothes and visit non-essential stores. Due to these restrictions that are in place, people are
            unable to receive a proper shopping experience which can lead to unexpected outcomes when online shopping,
            whether that be incorrect sizing or simply purchasing clothes that do not fit into their current wardrobe.
            We also quickly found that all members of the group share a common interest for clothing and trying new
            styles of clothing, as well as window shopping and browsing through various retailers and stores, prior to
            the current restrictions that are in place. As a result we decided to create a platform that would allow for
            a visual representation of what different pieces of clothing would look like together when worn in the same
            outfit, while also assisting online purchases in ensuring that the correct size of clothing is brought. In
            addition to this project being used as a tool for online shopping during COVID-19, individuals that are
            looking to expand their wardrobe and style would be able to see how different pieces of clothing would look
            like with each other before purchasing.
        </p>

        <h1>Aim and Goals

        </h1>
        <p>In line with our motivation, mentioned above, our aim for this project was to create a functioning webpage
            that will be able to offer a similar experience to shopping/browsing in store. With Victoria still currently
            under COVID-19 restrictions, shopping or browsing through clothes in physical locations is currently
            prohibited. This sparked the idea of creating a webpage that could work in place of physical stores whilst
            restrictions are still in place. With most of our group members currently studying subjects like Web
            Programming or Programming 1; as well as having some previous experience with coding experience, we all
            thought it would be a challenge to work together to create a functional website tailored to people like
            ourselves who would also benefit from its functionality.<br>
            Our first main goal was for our project idea to be approved by Dr B and our Mentor. With all members being
            relatively new to Web Programming and Programming, let alone collaborating with each other to create a fully
            functional website, we wanted to seek advice and information from a more experienced perspective as to how
            we should approach this project and what features will be required. After also presenting our idea to fellow
            peers and receiving their feedback, we were able to finalise what the main functionality of our final
            website will be as well as roughly divide the work and allocate roles based on individual strengths.
            Our second goal was to plan our approach to the project in our given situation. We also delegated each other
            roles based on our strengths and weaknesses, whilst also making it apparent as to who we should reach out to
            when in need for assistance, whether this be tutors or fellow group members. After laying out a plan to
            approach and go about the completion of this project, we each aimed to get familiar with the tools we were
            to be using for this project. More specifically, we ensured that each group member was familiar with how to
            use github to collaborate, as a few members were not experienced with this tool. Following all the
            preparation, our group also planned out our micro deadlines and meetings in order to keep the team and the
            production of the website on track.<br>
            Our third goal was to finalise our project itself. Knowing that external factors such as other assignments,
            extracurricular activities and roadblocks were more than likely to push us back in meeting micro deadlines;
            our group aimed to help each other out in this phase by providing any individual input/advice, working
            together in solving any problems and doing individual research and reporting any findings back to the
            group.<br>

        </p>

        <h1>Scope

        </h1>
        <p>The scope of our project will mainly be measured using the outcomes stated by our minimum viable features.
            Within the timeframe our main goal is to give the user the ability to create different blueprints based on
            the items of clothing that they have chosen from available options. This will be the minimum that we hope to
            achieve by the decided upon due date. Further features based on the MVFs will be developed from there as the
            other features directly build on this functionality. These features will be measured against the user
            stories and diagrams that we have drawn up previously, these will be used as outcomes for the functionality
            of these MVFs.

        </p>

        <h1>Project Progress

        </h1>
        <p>Our project began when we found that most members had similar abilities in terms of web programming and
            programming in general. We all found that most of us were learning Web Programming which resulted in the
            decision to make a website for the project. We also considered how we could create a website that would
            benefit individuals in the current situation, especially people living in Victoria who are currently under
            COVID-19 restrictions. As a result we concluded that a “outfit builder” website that would be able to
            visually assist users when browsing through clothes online would be interesting to all of us as well being
            beneficial to other people, given that shopping or browsing in physical stores and retailers is currently
            prohibited.<br>
            Given the unprecedented situations we are currently in, throughout the semester, our group endeavoured to
            regularly communicate and update each other regarding our progress and any concerns that had come up. We
            made sure that all members were all on the same page at the end of the week while also helping each other
            out and contributing to our group according to our strengths. Towards the peak of the semester, our group
            slightly fell behind our initial schedule and communication between members regarding what tasks needed to
            be completed, when they needed to be completed by and when our micro deadlines were not as frequent as
            before; also taking into account the current situation, and not being able to physically meet each other. We
            came across roadblocks and struggles with our design, as we had to decide how to most accurately depict the
            clothes would look like on our avatar. We also had trouble with hosting our final website as we included PHP
            as part of our backend code, causing some issues to arise with AWS. However, our group managed to clearly
            communicate and effectively plan our approach towards the completion of our project. All members strived to
            help each other out and finish their tasks. Also making the most of the advice and feedback obtained from
            our mentors and classmates, our group was able to adapt and change our plans accordingly.<br>
        </p>

        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Ultimately, our group was able to get all 5 MVFs working at the expected level that was initially planned at
            the start of the semester. Having to accommodate and adapt to some unexpected roadblocks as well as feedback
            received throughout the semester, our group managed to create a working prototype in line with our initial
            proposal.
        </p>

        <h2>Select and Browse Through Clothes</h2>
        <p>One of the integral features that allow a user to choose the clothes that are available through the
            utilisation of a dropdown list for each respective category. The website will have 4 available options:
            Tops, Bottoms, Shoes and Accessories. From there, you will be able to choose from a list of nine clothing
            items for each category.
        </p>

        <img src="projectimages/1.PNG" alt="error">

        <p>The UI throughout the website is kept to a minimalistic look, to make things look neat and concise
            throughout.<br>
            The figure below shows what the user will see when clicking into one of the dropdown lists. They will then
            be allowed to select any clothes that they might have an interest in. The clothes in the site have been
            selected by our team with the price and store page that is accessible from the clothes, as this gives users
            the chance to purchase specific clothes that they have shown interest in, therefore eliminating the hassle
            of trying to find it themselves.<br>

        <img src="projectimages/2.PNG" alt="">


        <h2>Clothes on a Avatar</h2>
        <p>One of the other features that are important to the goal of the website is allowing to show the user what the
            clothes look like on an example dummy (avatar.) This is validated as selecting the clothes that are desired
            will show up on the avatar.<br>
            This has been implemented, albeit a little bit rough (as of right now.) The main goal, however, has been
            fulfilled as it allows the user to get an idea of what it would look like on a body. The user will be able
            to choose any clothes that attracts them to display onto the avatar to have an accurate presentation on how
            the clothes will look together. The user can also put in their own clothes to create a visual representation
            on their clothes with the clothes they may possibly purchase.<br>

        </p>

        </a>

        <img src="projectimages/3.PNG" alt="">

        <h2>Random Clothes Generator</h2>
        <p>This feature is exactly as it sounds, it randomises the choice of clothing that is shown on the avatar. This
            is achieved on the website through the use of a button labeled 'Randomize' resulting in a randomised
            outfit.<br>
            We thought this was a good feature to have as the outfits generated are random to give the user inspiration
            or ideas to make their own personal outfit. With this random generated outfit feature it gives a new look on
            different ideas that may have happened in real life stores when browsing clothes. The figure below will show
            a demonstration of the randomisation process.

        </p>

        </a>

        <img src="projectimages/4.PNG" alt="">

        <h2>Saved Outfits</h2>
        <p>This one saves the user's current look on the avatar where they can then choose to look back on it any time.
            For example, if they are done doing other designs, they can just press load outfit, which will bring back
            the saved outfit they created previously. As it can be seen, these buttons are placed in a line (all three
            buttons) so that it is easier for the user to not scramble for a few seconds trying to find each option.<br>
            This feature lets the user create their outfits to use at a later date. This allows users to make outfits
            for later to use with any originally owned pieces of clothing to create the outfit when you need to go out.
            This gives a good reference when users need to create an outfit when you need to go out. While it does not
            fully look like what it does in our mockup from the previous part of the assignment, its core functionality
            works as intended.

        </p>

        </a>

        <img src="projectimages/5.PNG" alt="">

        <h2>Purchasing Clothes From Partnered Stores</h2>
        <p>As said in previous features, the clothing that has been collected from different stores will also have an
            available link that will allow users to purchase from that selected store. This is done with the thought
            that users will want to purchase some of the items that have been used for demonstration purposes on the
            website.<br>
            This helps users be directly connected to a place to purchase making the user not have to search it to find
            it. There are two buttons: 'purchase' and 'view similar items' for each item on the website. The ‘purchase’
            button will send you directly to the purchase side whereas the 'view similar items' will send you to the
            part of the website where similar items are available. For example, if you were to click on the 'view
            similar items' button under the tops selection, it would send you via the link where you can view more mens
            tops.<br>
        </p>

        <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/e241001238af428a93798f5045c053cc?from_recorder=1" target="_blank">Video Link
        </a>

        <img src="projectimages/6.PNG" alt="">

        <p>For example, a user wants to view both the purchase link and similar items.</p>

        <img src="projectimages/7.PNG" alt="">

        <p>The user can click the 'purchase' button and it will send them to their desired destination</p>

        <img src="projectimages/8.PNG" alt="">
        <p>Similarly, if the user chose the 'view similar items' button it would send them to, for this example, an area
            where you can view other denim jackets</p>




        <h1>Extended Viable Features</h1>
        <p>
            Upon the successful implementation of our proposed MVFs, our group managed to plan how we would implement
            and begin these EVFs, should the website be continued in the future.
        </p>

        <h2>Sharing Outfits With Friends</h2>

            This feature gives the user the ability to share their customisations with those they wish to without going
            through the hassle of trying to manually do it. This should be an automatic process that is done by the
            website; it should allow the user to view their creation before uploading it to a social media of their
            choosing. A feature like this would benefit greatly for the website as it would give a more immersive
            experience while giving users more reason to search through the clothes.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Validation Test

            This features while, quite simple in concept, will give more freedom to the user when viewing angles on
            clothes that they could view if they were shopping in stores. This will allow for a more immersive
            experience for the user and also provide a more in depth look at the clothes they have chosen. This will
            result in allowing the user to have a good reference of what it will truly look like by giving them a 360
            degree field of view.

            This feature allows the user to choose from different types of avatars that consist of different body
            proportions. This not only adds more customizability, but also adds an extra feeling of accuracy regarding
            how it would look like on a body size more accurate to the user. This can give the real life feeling of
            clothes shopping while being at home due to the COVID-19 lockdown.

        <h1>Scope Creep</h1>
        <p>This project has become the project that we aimed to build in the first assignment. The project has been on a
            good path to become what we envisioned it to be but one of the aspects of the project has changed from the
            original plan that has made the project a bit harder to make. This was the making of multiple avatars which
            we received feedback to include into the project. This left us changing the work a bit and changing the work
            loads and due dates. Although this may have arised, our group has worked with it being flexible and
            integrated the feature into our plans. This shows how our group handled an unexpected problem to arise which
            we adapted to solve the problem within our time frame.<br>

        <h1>Windfall</h1>
        <p>The planning of this project had accounted for the requirements and work that we needed to complete by a due
            date. This was done with trello setting each due date for certain tasks to be done so we could move on with
            the project. Although we set each task to a certain group member and a due date some of the tasks were
            completed before the due dates meaning that some members were able to help or move on with other tasks. This
            meant that the project was being completed at a faster pace than expected leaving more time to edit or
            revise over the project. This gave us more time and so the estimation of the completion of the project was
            shortened giving us more time to revise or change anything.

        <h1>Future Improvements for our website</h1>
        <p>Given the small scale of this project being more a prototype than a final, fully operational website; we have
            chosen to hard code most elements, such as our images of clothing. This was done to ensure that our main
            intended functionalities of our website were to be completed and running smoothly.<br>

            In order to enhance our existing prototype and elevate it to a level where it is fit for real-world
            situations; future developments could include developing a more sophisticated back-end system whether this
            is in the form of a database or JSON file. This development will allow backend users to have easier access
            when updating/editing clothes and links, while also being able to accommodate our proposed extended
            features, such as saving multiple clothes under an account name and sharing them via social media platforms.
            These improvements will allow for our prototype to be used by a wider audience form customers to back end
            users.<br>

            Moving forward an area for improvement on the website could be creating a more realistic model for the
            clothes do be displayed on; this could be something like a virtual 3D model of a male or female that would
            make displaying the clothes for the user a more realistic and clear experience.<br>

            Relating back to our main motivations and purpose of our website, partnering up with local retailers,
            offering them a platform to showcase their range of products in a different way would also be a highly
            likely pathway for our project to go down.<br>
