        <h1>Project Background</h1>
        <p>Our website, The Drip Selector, gives users the ability to preview the look of items of clothing on a model.
            The app will allow users to select pictures of pre loaded clothes and see what they will look like together,
            for example a user will be able to select a t-shirt and a pair of jeans and the program will generate each
            of these on an avatar on the screen. This will allow the user to get an accurate representation of what the
            clothes will look like. Users will then be able to follow a link provided by the site which takes them to a
            store front that has the items of clothing they are previewing for sale. We will have different sections for
            Pants, t-shirts and other items of clothing to make the user experience more friendly and organized. <br>
            <br>
            The clothes on the website will be clearly labeled so the user is quickly able to tell the brand and name of
            the clothes that they are previewing. The majority of the page will be taken up by the model that the
            clothes will be placed on and then next to this model will be the selection of clothes that the user can
            place on the model. Next to the pieces of clothing will be links that take the user to a storefront that
            sells that piece of clothing allowing them to quickly access a vendor for this piece.<br>
            <br>
            Given the current situation Victoria is in, many people are not able to leave their suburbs, let alone
            purchase clothes and visit non-essential stores. Due to these restrictions that are in place, people are
            unable to receive a proper shopping experience which can lead to unexpected outcomes when online shopping,
            whether that be incorrect sizing or simply purchasing clothes that do not fit into their current wardrobe.
            We also quickly found that all members of the group share a common interest for clothing and trying new
            styles of clothing, as well as window shopping and browsing through various retailers and stores, prior to
            the current restrictions that are in place. As a result we decided to create a platform that would allow for
            a visual representation of what different pieces of clothing would look like together when worn in the same
            outfit, while also assisting online purchases in ensuring that the correct size of clothing is brought. In
            addition to this project being used as a tool for online shopping during COVID-19, individuals that are
            looking to expand their wardrobe and style would be able to see how different pieces of clothing would look
            like with each other before purchasing.

        <h2>Fisseha Abate</h2>
        <p>I have long been interested in Information Technology ever since I was a small child. Growing up, I found
            devices such as computers, mobile phones along with other tech gadgets quite intriguing. This curiosity
            would then drive me to finding out more about computers and how they functioned. Although I had growing
            interests for other fields such as sports and art, along the road, IT was the one thing I always had the
            most interest for.</p>

        <h2>Paul Curran</h2>
        <p>I have always been passionate about technology throughout my life, my first interest was video games, ever
            since I was young I have always been interested in game in general and I think this acted as a gateway for
            me into other areas of IT. Growing up I would often try different things in the area of IT such as basic
            photoshop and video editing software that I found interesting and entertaining. As I got older I started
            getting more interested in programming and this is where I think my future lies within the industry as I
            find programming in general very interesting and challenging.<br>
            Over the past couple of years I think I have become fairly proficient programming at a beginner level and
            hope to improve these skills moving forward. I am a harder worker and like to perform well at tasks which I
            lend well to this kind work with more definitive measures of success and milestones. I also have a fairly
            good beginner level understanding of web design and user centered design. I believe I also work well in a
            team and good at contributing to work and helping others when necessary
            In relation to this project I think the report writing clear and succinct write ups would be a challenge for
            me.<br>
            I expect to perform a role that relates to the programming and development of the software in this project.
            I think that a role like this could fit in with my skills well and would provide a good challenge for me
            moving forward.<br>
            For the duration of this project I definitely learnt a lot about technical aspects that I wasn’t as well
            versed in such as web programming languages like javascript, css, php and html. I was happy about this
            outcome because it was one of my goals at the outset of the project. Challenges that I faced were mostly
            related to the strategies that were used for programming projects within a group. Having different people
            performing different tasks on the same programming project was definitely something that I became more
            comfortable with as the project went on. Being assisted by programs such as Github and Trello was certainly
            helpful and the things I learnt using these programs are something that I will definitely use in the
            future.<br>

        <h2>Cliff Kristianto</h2>
        <p>Growing up I have always been around technology through the use of computers and iPads throughout my
            schooling. Since then I have been interested in learning about how to use these tools and how to learn about
            the different ways I could use them. I have also always looked up to my Dad who works in the field of
            Information Technology, which inspired me to undertake Information Technology at RMIT in 2020.<br>
            I believe that I am good at working with others in a team as well as clearly communicating with team members
            and playing an active role as a team member. I also believe that I am a quick learner when working with
            people who I can easily communicate with and learn from. As my programming skills are still in development,
            I strived to contribute to the group in other ways as much as I can such as documentation or participating
            in weekly standups/presentations. As a result, my assigned roles for the team naturally led towards more
            documentation, presentations and management.<br>

            Throughout this project I have been introduced to many new technologies and ways of working that I have
            never had previous experience with. This includes using a collaborative coding tool such as GitHub to work
            on this project together. This has taught me how to approach coding as a team, something which I have never
            done before. Coming into this course with little to no experience in programming, I have also learnt from
            the more experienced members of the group regarding different and more efficient ways to write HTML, CSS and
            JavaScript.<br>

        <h2>Hayden Tran</h2>
        <p>I’ve been interested in Technology ever since I was allowed to access a computer at my Grandma’s house. It
            was the access to different types of applications such as games (mostly) and web surfing that made me
            enthralled with technology. That soon grew to being much more interested in other forms of technology such
            as when smartphones were in their infancy post release of the first iPhone. Around year 10 was when I got
            into the IT coding side of things as my friend, who was a huge ‘nerd’, knew quite a substantial amount on
            how to program and used his knowledge to create interesting programs that fascinated a lot of people,
            including me; although my coding ability is still of a novice.<br>
            As I wasn’t as well versed in coding compared to my other team members, I held more commitment to the side
            of documentation which was where the majority of my time was spent. Throughout this three-part project,
            there have been many new tools and technologies that I didn’t really know how to use, but now understand to
            gain important experience if I were to use it later in other projects. Such instances are with the use of
            Microsoft Teams and GitHub, as they were still tools that I wasn’t quite confident with using. The
            collaboration side of it however has taught me how it can be used beneficially when working with others,
            which has expanded my experience with group work. I have also learnt a little bit of coding thanks to other
            team members, such as when making websites with CSS, JavaScript etc.<br>
            Working with my team members has been a good experience too, as we each established what areas we were
            stronger in. Our use of messenger has also greatly helped with the communication part, which has resulted in
            no glaring issues with feedback and discussion.<br>

        <h2>Matthew Cham 
        </h2>
        <p>I’ve been interested in technology since I was very young when I got a gaming console as a present. Since
            then I had always loved anything that was technology, always trying to see if I could do anything cool with
            the stuff I had. Growing up with technology all around me made it a very important part of my life. Having
            asian parents who had no idea about any technology I was the person who would always deal with anything
            technology. This made me want to be the best at it so I can always help my parents with anything that deals
            with technology.<br>
            Over the first semester I found that I was good at completing tasks on time and working well with others.
            Working with a team was good and enjoyable when the team communicated well. I’m interested in any technology
            as it makes me want to mess with it and edit it if possible to see if I can make it cooler or different.
            Games have always interested me since I got my first console when I was younger. Playing games have always
            been a very important part that I enjoyed throughout my life. Coding has always interested me being the
            language that creates all programs so it can let you do anything if you know how to use it.<br>
            My programming skills aren’t that proficient so working on the website using Github may be a struggle. In
            this project I expect to have a role that is equal to everyone in the group that is fair and is done to our
            strengths. I expect to help in any aspect of the project that needs help and to work on everything as a
            group. So doing the programming, research and any other tasks that may need to be done should be distributed
            equally amongst the group.
